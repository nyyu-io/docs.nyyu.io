# What is the process for vetting and selecting startups on NYYU?

The process for vetting and selecting new ventures on NYYU involves several key steps to ensure the quality and integrity of the investment avenues. Firstly, virtually every type of startup is considered for listing on the platform, except for those involved in unethical industries such as military applications or pornography. Regarding vetting procedures, several steps are undertaken. 

Firstly, new ventures are required to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks. Secondly, a background check is conducted on the officers and directors of the company to verify their credentials and integrity. Thirdly, new ventures may need to obtain any necessary licenses or regulatory approvals, such as filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for offerings or Regulation A filings.

Additionally, new ventures are required to complete their offering statements with relevant regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the Financial Conduct Authority of their country of registration. Finally, a thorough due diligence process is conducted on the business to ensure its viability and suitability for listing on NYYU. These stringent vetting procedures are in place to safeguard investor interests and maintain the quality of investment avenues on the platform.
