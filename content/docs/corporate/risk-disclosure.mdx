## 1. Market Risk

<div className="p-6 rounded-xl border border-amber-500/30 bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-500/10 to-orange-500/10 my-6">
  <div className="font-bold mb-3">Price Volatility</div>
  <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    The value of digital assets can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Prices can fluctuate significantly within a short period, and the value of your investments can increase or decrease rapidly. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
  </div>
</div>

## 2. Liquidity Risk

Digital assets may have limited liquidity, meaning that it can be difficult to buy or sell them quickly at desired prices. Market conditions, regulatory actions, or other factors may impact the liquidity of digital assets, potentially resulting in significant losses.

## 3. Legal and Regulatory Risk

<div className="p-6 rounded-lg border border-border bg-muted/30 my-6">
  <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
    <div className="text-3xl">‚öñÔ∏è</div>
    <div className="flex-1 text-sm">
      The legal and regulatory environment for digital assets is evolving and may change rapidly. Changes in laws, regulations, or government policies can impact the value, legality, and use of digital assets. Regulatory actions may also result in the suspension or cessation of services.

  </div>
</div>

## 4. Technology Risk

## 5. Security Risk

Digital assets are susceptible to security breaches, hacking, and theft. NYYU takes measures to secure your assets and personal information, but we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.

## 6. Operational Risk

<div className="pl-6 border-l-2 border-amber-500/30 my-6 text-sm">

## 7. Counterparty Risk

When engaging in transactions on the NYYU platform, you are exposed to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party to the transaction may default or fail to fulfill their obligations.

## 8. Risk of Loss

<Callout type="error" className="my-6">
**Only Invest What You Can Afford to Lose:** You should only invest funds that you can afford to lose completely. Trading and investing in digital assets involve a high risk of total loss.
</Callout>

## 9. Tax Risk
