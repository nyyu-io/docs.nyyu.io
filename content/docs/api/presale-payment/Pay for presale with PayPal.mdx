The `paypalForPresale` mutation allows a user to create a PayPal checkout order for a presale order. The frontend (FE) will be redirected to the PayPal checkout page.

### Mutation: `paypalForPresale`

#### Schema:
```graphql
paypalForPresale(
  presaleId: Int!,
  orderId: Int!,
  currencyCode: String!
): OrderResponseDTO
```

#### Parameters

- `presaleId` (Int): The ID of the presale. This field is mandatory.
- `orderId` (Int): The ID of the order to pay for. This field is mandatory.
- `currencyCode` (String): The currency code for the payment (e.g., "USD"). This field is mandatory.

#### Return

The mutation returns an `OrderResponseDTO` object which contains the necessary information to redirect to the PayPal checkout page.

### Example Mutation

The following is an example of how to use the `paypalForPresale` mutation to create a PayPal checkout order for a presale order:

```graphql
mutation {
  paypalForPresale(
    presaleId: 1,
    orderId: 123,
    currencyCode: "USD"
  ) {
    orderId,
    redirectUrl
  }
}
```

### Note

- The frontend will be redirected to the PayPal checkout page using the URL provided in the `OrderResponseDTO`.

In this example, the mutation initiates a PayPal payment for the presale order with ID `123` in the presale with ID `1`. The payment will be made in USD. The return value includes the `OrderResponseDTO` details such as `orderId` and `redirectUrl`, which can be used to redirect the user to the PayPal checkout page.
