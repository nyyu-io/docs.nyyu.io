The `placePreSaleOrder` mutation allows a user to place a new presale order with specified details.

### Mutation: `placePreSaleOrder`

#### Schema:
```graphql
placePreSaleOrder(
  presaleId: Int!,
  ndbAmount: Float!,
  destination: Int!,
  extAddr: String
): PreSaleOrder
```

#### Parameters

- `presaleId` (Int): The ID of the presale to place an order. This field is mandatory.
- `ndbAmount` (Float): The amount of NDB tokens to purchase in the order. This field is mandatory.
- `destination` (Int): Specifies the destination after purchase is successful. Possible values:
  - `1`: Internal
  - `2`: External
- `extAddr` (String): If the destination is external, the external address to receive NDB tokens. This field is optional but required if `destination` is `2`.

#### Return

The mutation returns the created `PreSaleOrder` object.

### Example Mutation

The following is an example of how to use the `placePreSaleOrder` mutation to place a new presale order:

```graphql
mutation {
  placePreSaleOrder(
    presaleId: 1,
    ndbAmount: 500.0,
    destination: 2,
    extAddr: "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"
  ) {
    id,
    presaleId,
    userId,
    ndbAmount,
    destination,
    extAddr,
    status,
    createdAt,
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

### Note

- The default status of the order is `0`. It must be confirmed by any payment later.
- If the `destination` is `2` (external), the `extAddr` field must be provided.

In this example, the mutation places a presale order for the presale with ID `1`, purchasing `500` NDB tokens, with the destination set to external and an external address specified. The return value includes the details of the created `PreSaleOrder`.
