The `getNewPresaleOrders` query is used to retrieve all newly placed presale orders in a specified presale round, starting from a specified order ID. This is useful for updating the presale order list on the user side.

### Query: `getNewPresaleOrders`

#### Schema:
```graphql
getNewPresaleOrders(
  presaleId: Int!,
  lastOrderId: Int!
): [PreSaleOrder]
```

#### Parameters

- `presaleId` (Int): The ID of the presale round to retrieve new orders for. This field is mandatory.
- `lastOrderId` (Int): The ID of the last order to start retrieving new orders from. This field is mandatory.

#### Return

The query returns a list of `PreSaleOrder` objects that were placed after the specified order ID in the specified presale round.

### Example Query

The following is an example of how to use the `getNewPresaleOrders` query to retrieve all newly placed orders in a specific presale round:

```graphql
query {
  getNewPresaleOrders(
    presaleId: 1,
    lastOrderId: 100
  ) {
    id,
    presaleId,
    userId,
    ndbAmount,
    destination,
    extAddr,
    status,
    createdAt,
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

In this example, the query retrieves all new presale orders for the presale round with ID `1` that were placed after the order with ID `100`. Each `PreSaleOrder` object in the returned list includes details such as `id`, `presaleId`, `userId`, `ndbAmount`, `destination`, `extAddr`, `status`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
