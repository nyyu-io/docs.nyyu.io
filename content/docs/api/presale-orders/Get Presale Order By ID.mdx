The `getPresaleById` query is used to retrieve a single presale order based on its unique ID.

### Query: `getPresaleById`

#### Schema:
```graphql
getPresaleById(
  id: Int!
): PreSaleOrder
```

#### Parameters

- `id` (Int): The unique ID of the presale order to retrieve. This field is mandatory.

#### Return

The query returns a `PreSaleOrder` object that corresponds to the specified ID.

### Example Query

The following is an example of how to use the `getPresaleById` query to retrieve a single presale order by its ID:

```graphql
query {
  getPresaleById(
    id: 123
  ) {
    id,
    presaleId,
    userId,
    ndbAmount,
    destination,
    extAddr,
    status,
    createdAt,
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

In this example, the query retrieves the presale order with the ID `123`. The returned `PreSaleOrder` object includes details such as `id`, `presaleId`, `userId`, `ndbAmount`, `destination`, `extAddr`, `status`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
