The `captureOrderForDeposit` mutation allows a user to confirm a PayPal payment for a deposit into their wallet. The backend will verify the payment and, if successful, add the balance to the user's internal wallet.

### Mutation: `captureOrderForDeposit`

#### Schema:
```graphql
captureOrderForDeposit(
  orderId: String!
): Boolean
```

#### Parameters

- `orderId` (String): The PayPal checkout order ID. This field is mandatory.

#### Return

The mutation returns a `Boolean` indicating whether the PayPal order was successfully captured and the balance was added to the internal wallet.

### Example Mutation

The following is an example of how to use the `captureOrderForDeposit` mutation to confirm a PayPal payment for a deposit:

```graphql
mutation {
  captureOrderForDeposit(
    orderId: "PAYPAL_ORDER_ID"
  )
}
```

### Return

The example returns `true` if the PayPal order was successfully captured and the balance was added to the internal wallet, or `false` otherwise.

In this example, the mutation captures the PayPal order with the ID `PAYPAL_ORDER_ID`. The backend will check if the payment has been processed successfully. If successful, the balance will be added to the user's internal wallet.
