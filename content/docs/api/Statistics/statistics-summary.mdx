```graphql
type RoundPerform1 {
  roundNumber: Int!,
  tokenPrice: Float!,
  soldAmount: Float!
}
```

##### Fields
- `roundNumber` (Int): The round number.
- `tokenPrice` (Float): The token price during the round.
- `soldAmount` (Float): The amount of tokens sold during the round.

#### RoundPerform2
Represents additional performance metrics for a specific round.

```graphql
type RoundPerform2 {
  roundNumber: Int!,
  min: Float!,
  max: Float!,
  std: Float!
}
```

##### Fields
- `roundNumber` (Int): The round number.
- `min` (Float): The minimum value of the metric.
- `max` (Float): The maximum value of the metric.
- `std` (Float): The standard deviation of the metric.

#### RoundChance
Represents the winning and failing rates for a specific round.

```graphql
type RoundChance {
  roundNumber: Int!,
  winRate: Float!,
  failedRate: Float!
}
```

##### Fields
- `roundNumber` (Int): The round number.
- `winRate` (Float): The winning rate for the round.
- `failedRate` (Float): The failing rate for the round.

### Queries

#### getRoundPerform1
Retrieves the performance metrics for all rounds (token price and sold amount).

```graphql
getRoundPerform1: [RoundPerform1]
```

##### Example Query

```graphql
query {
  getRoundPerform1 {
    roundNumber,
    tokenPrice,
    soldAmount
  }
}
```

##### Return
Returns a list of `RoundPerform1` objects.

#### getRoundPerform2
Retrieves additional performance metrics for all rounds (min, max, and std).

```graphql
getRoundPerform2: [RoundPerform2]
```

##### Example Query

```graphql
query {
  getRoundPerform2 {
    roundNumber,
    min,
    max,
    std
  }
}
```

##### Return
Returns a list of `RoundPerform2` objects.

#### getRoundChance
Retrieves the winning and failing rates for all rounds.

```graphql
getRoundChance: [RoundChance]
```

##### Example Query

```graphql
query {
  getRoundChance {
    roundNumber,
    winRate,
    failedRate
  }
}
```

##### Return
Returns a list of `RoundChance` objects.

### Schema

```graphql
schema {
  query: Query
}
```

Defines the `Query` type that includes the `getRoundPerform1`, `getRoundPerform2`, and `getRoundChance` queries.
