The `releaseUserByAdmin` mutation allows an admin to release a previously suspended user's account. This can be used to restore a user's access to the system.

### Mutation: `releaseUserByAdmin`

#### Schema:
```graphql
releaseUserByAdmin(
  email: String!
): String
```

#### Parameters

- `email` (String): The email address of the user to be released. This field is mandatory.

#### Return

The mutation returns a string indicating the result of the release attempt.

- `"Success"`: Indicates that the user's account has been successfully released.
- `"Failed"`: Indicates that there was an error in processing the request, such as the user not being found or not being suspended.

### Example Mutation

The following is an example of how to use the `releaseUserByAdmin` mutation to release a user's account:

```graphql
mutation {
  releaseUserByAdmin(
    email: "user@example.com"
  )
}
```

In this example, the mutation attempts to release the user with the email address `user@example.com`. The return value will indicate whether the release was successful.
