The `getAuctionByStatus` query is used to retrieve auction rounds based on their status.

### Query: `getAuctionByStatus`

#### Schema:
```graphql
query getAuctionByStatus(
  status: Int!
): [Auction]
```

#### Parameters

- `status` (Int): The status of the auction rounds to retrieve. This field is mandatory.

#### Return

The query returns a list of `Auction` objects that have the specified status.

### Example Query

The following is an example of how to use the `getAuctionByStatus` query to retrieve auction rounds by status:

```graphql
query {
  getAuctionByStatus(
    status: 1
  ) {
    id,
    round,
    startedAt,
    duration,
    totalToken,
    minPrice,
    avatar {
      groupId,
      compId
    },
    token,
    status
  }
}
```

In this example, the query retrieves auction rounds with the status `1`. Each `Auction` object in the returned list includes `id`, `round`, `startedAt`, `duration`, `totalToken`, `minPrice`, `avatar`, `token`, and `status` of the auctions.
