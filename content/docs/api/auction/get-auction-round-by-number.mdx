The `getAuctionByNumber` query is used to retrieve a specific auction round based on its round number.

### Query: `getAuctionByNumber`

  round: Int!
): Auction
```

#### Parameters

- `round` (Int): The round number of the auction to retrieve. This field is mandatory.

#### Return

### Example Query

The following is an example of how to use the `getAuctionByNumber` query to retrieve an auction round by its round number:

```graphql
query {
  getAuctionByNumber(
    round: 12
  ) {
    id,
    round,
    startedAt,
    duration,
    totalToken,
    minPrice,
    avatar {
      groupId,
      compId
