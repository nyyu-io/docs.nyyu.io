# Proof of Reserves on NYYU

At NYYU, transparency and security are our top priorities. Our Proof of Reserves program is designed to provide our users with the assurance that all digital and fiat assets held on the platform are backed 1:1. This ensures that your assets are secure and verifiable at all times.

## What is Proof of Reserves?

Proof of Reserves is a process that allows NYYU to publicly demonstrate that we hold sufficient reserves to cover all user balances. This process involves regular third-party audits and cryptographic verification to ensure transparency and trust.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step>
### Third-Party Audits
We engage reputable third-party auditing firms to conduct regular audits of our reserves. These audits verify that the total amount of assets held by NYYU matches the total amount of user assets on the platform.
</Step>

<Step>
### Cryptographic Verification
Users can independently verify that their assets are included in the total reserves through cryptographic proofs. This method ensures that individual user balances are accounted for without compromising privacy.
</Step>

<Step>
### Regular Reporting
Audit reports and verification proofs are published regularly on our platform, providing users with up-to-date information on our reserve status.
</Step>

</Steps>
