# De-Listing Policy on NYYU

At NYYU, we prioritize maintaining a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for our users. To ensure the integrity and quality of the assets listed on our platform, we have established a comprehensive de-listing policy. This policy outlines the criteria and process for the de-listing of assets that no longer meet our standards.

## Criteria for De-Listing

An asset may be considered for de-listing from the NYYU platform under the following circumstances:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations, or legal requirements.
2. **Security Concerns**: Discovery of critical security vulnerabilities or unresolved technical issues.
3. **Market Performance**: Consistently low trading volume or lack of liquidity.
4. **Project Development**: Abandonment of the project, lack of updates, or significant changes in the project's roadmap or objectives.
5. **Community Engagement**: Poor community engagement, negative feedback, or loss of community trust.
6. **Fraudulent Activities**: Involvement in fraudulent, deceptive, or unethical activities.
7. **Request by Project Team**: Formal request from the project team to de-list the asset.
