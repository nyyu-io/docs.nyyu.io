### Trading Physical Commodities

If you're interested in trading physical commodities, we've got you covered. You can buy and sell these commodities directly on our platform, giving you ownership of the underlying assets.

### Trading Futures Contracts

In addition to physical commodities, we also offer futures contracts for trading. Futures contracts are financial tools that let investors bet on commodity price changes without owning the actual assets. This approach offers advantages such as liquidity, leverage, and the ability to hedge against price fluctuations.
