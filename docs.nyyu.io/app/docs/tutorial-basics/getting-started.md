### The Mission

### Clients
Broker-dealers, financial institutions, businesses, and individuals.

### Clientâ€™s Problems
The fiat currency system operates independently of physical commodities and is managed by centralized authorities in response to supply and demand dynamics. However, this system is susceptible to risks such as inflation, which can result in financial losses.

### Confirmation of the Problem
- **Historical and Theoretical Understanding**: The concept of fiat currency, where the value is based on government decree rather than being backed by physical assets like gold, has been widely documented and studied in economic theories and historical records.
- **Centralized Control**: Central banks and monetary authorities play a crucial role in managing and regulating the fiat currency system. They have the authority to adjust interest rates, implement monetary policies, and intervene in currency markets to address supply and demand dynamics.
- **Inflation Risks**: The fiat currency system is susceptible to inflation, which occurs when there is an excessive increase in the money supply relative to goods and services available. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of currency and can lead to financial losses for individuals and businesses.
