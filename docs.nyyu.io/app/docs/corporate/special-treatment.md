# Special Treatment Policy

At NYYU, we strive to maintain a fair and transparent trading environment. Our Special Treatment Policy is designed to address specific situations where enhanced measures are necessary to protect the integrity of our platform and ensure a level playing field for all users. This policy outlines the criteria and procedures for placing assets, accounts, or projects under special treatment.

## Criteria for Special Treatment

Assets, accounts, or projects may be placed under special treatment if they meet one or more of the following criteria:

### 1. Abnormal Trading Activity

- Unusual trading volume or price movements that cannot be explained by market conditions.
- Significant discrepancies between market value and trading volume.

### 2. Security Concerns

- Reports of security vulnerabilities or breaches that could impact the safety of user funds.
- Evidence of hacking, fraud, or other malicious activities.

### 3. Regulatory Issues

- Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
- Regulatory actions or investigations that may affect the asset or project.

### 4. Operational Concerns

- Inconsistencies in project disclosures or failure to provide required information.
- Delays or issues in project development or deployment that affect its viability.

### 5. Market Manipulation

- Evidence of market manipulation, including pump-and-dump schemes, wash trading, or spoofing.
- Activities that artificially inflate or deflate the value of an asset.

## Procedures for Special Treatment

When an asset, account, or project is placed under special treatment, the following procedures will be implemented:

### Notification

- **Initial Notification**: We will notify the relevant parties (e.g., project team, asset issuer) of the special treatment status and the reasons for the decision.
- **Public Announcement**: A public announcement will be made to inform the community of the special treatment status and provide relevant details.

### Enhanced Monitoring

- **Increased Scrutiny**: Transactions and activities related to the asset, account, or project will be subject to enhanced monitoring.
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic reviews will be conducted to assess the ongoing risk and determine if the special treatment status should be maintained or lifted.

### Restrictions

- **Trading Restrictions**: Trading of the affected asset may be temporarily suspended or restricted.
- **Account Limitations**: Accounts associated with the special treatment status may be subject to additional verification requirements or limitations on certain activities.

## Lifting of Special Treatment

The special treatment status may be lifted if the issues that led to the designation are resolved. This decision will be based on a thorough review and assessment of the situation. Relevant parties will be notified, and a public announcement will be made to inform the community.

## User Responsibilities

Users are expected to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and platform policies. Engaging in activities that violate our terms of service or pose a risk to the platform's integrity may result in special treatment status or other disciplinary actions.
