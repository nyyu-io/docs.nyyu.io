# Risk Disclosure

Investing in digital assets involves significant risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Before using the NYYU platform or engaging in any trading or investment activities, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk tolerance. This Risk Disclosure statement is provided to inform you of some of the risks associated with digital asset trading and investment.

## 1. Market Risk

The value of digital assets can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Prices can fluctuate significantly within a short period, and the value of your investments can increase or decrease rapidly. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

## 2. Liquidity Risk

Digital assets may have limited liquidity, meaning that it can be difficult to buy or sell them quickly at desired prices. Market conditions, regulatory actions, or other factors may impact the liquidity of digital assets, potentially resulting in significant losses.

## 3. Legal and Regulatory Risk

The legal and regulatory environment for digital assets is evolving and may change rapidly. Changes in laws, regulations, or government policies can impact the value, legality, and use of digital assets. Regulatory actions may also result in the suspension or cessation of services provided by NYYU or other platforms.

## 4. Technology Risk

Digital assets rely on blockchain technology, which is still in its early stages of development. Technological issues, such as software bugs, network outages, or cyberattacks, can disrupt the functioning of digital asset networks and result in the loss of assets or data.

## 5. Security Risk

Digital assets are susceptible to security breaches, hacking, and theft. NYYU takes measures to secure your assets and personal information, but we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for any activities that occur under your account.

## 6. Operational Risk

NYYU's platform and services may experience interruptions, delays, or failures due to various factors, including technical issues, maintenance, or cyberattacks. Such disruptions can affect your ability to access or use our services and may result in financial losses.

## 7. Counterparty Risk

When engaging in transactions on the NYYU platform, you are exposed to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party to the transaction may default or fail to fulfill their obligations. This risk can result in financial losses.

## 8. Risk of Loss

Trading and investing in digital assets involve a high risk of loss. You should only invest funds that you can afford to lose. You may lose all or a substantial portion of your investment.

## 9. Tax Risk

The tax treatment of digital asset transactions is uncertain and may vary by jurisdiction. You are responsible for understanding and complying with tax obligations related to your digital asset activities. NYYU does not provide tax advice.

## 10. Financial Advice

NYYU does not provide financial, investment, or legal advice. Any information provided through our platform is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice. You should seek independent professional advice before making any investment decisions.

## 11. No Guarantee of Profit

There is no guarantee that you will make a profit from trading or investing in digital assets. You may incur substantial losses and may not achieve your investment goals.

## 12. Acknowledgment
