# About Us

Welcome to NYYU, an innovative decentralized investment banking platform dedicated to transforming the financial landscape. We provide personalized solutions for broker-dealers, financial institutions, businesses, and individuals, offering a comprehensive suite of back-office and front-end capabilities to manage traditional and digital assets seamlessly.

## Our Vision

To create a financial system that breaks away from the traditional fiat currency system and establishes energy as the foundation of a new form of currency. This system aims to overcome the risks associated with inflation and centralized control, fostering sustainability and stable growth as energy supply and demand expand.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to develop and implement an innovative financial framework that utilizes energy as a currency. Through facilitated marketplaces, we aim to establish an alternative to the fiat currency system, providing an inflation-free and de-risked environment for financial transactions. Our goal is to foster sustainable economic growth by leveraging the expanding energy market and creating a stable foundation for financial activities.
