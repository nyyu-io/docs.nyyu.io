# De-Listing Policy on NYYU

At NYYU, we prioritize maintaining a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for our users. To ensure the integrity and quality of the assets listed on our platform, we have established a comprehensive de-listing policy. This policy outlines the criteria and process for the de-listing of assets that no longer meet our standards.

## Criteria for De-Listing

An asset may be considered for de-listing from the NYYU platform under the following circumstances:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations, or legal requirements.
2. **Security Concerns**: Discovery of critical security vulnerabilities or unresolved technical issues.
3. **Market Performance**: Consistently low trading volume or lack of liquidity.
4. **Project Development**: Abandonment of the project, lack of updates, or significant changes in the project's roadmap or objectives.
5. **Community Engagement**: Poor community engagement, negative feedback, or loss of community trust.
6. **Fraudulent Activities**: Involvement in fraudulent, deceptive, or unethical activities.
7. **Request by Project Team**: Formal request from the project team to de-list the asset.

## De-Listing Process

1. **Initial Review**: NYYU's Research and Compliance teams continuously monitor listed assets. If an asset meets any of the de-listing criteria, it will be flagged for further review.
2. **Notification**: The project team and relevant stakeholders will be notified of the potential de-listing and given an opportunity to address the concerns raised.
3. **Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation will be conducted to assess the severity of the issues and the potential impact on users.
4. **Decision**: Based on the evaluation, a decision will be made regarding the de-listing of the asset. The project team will be informed of the decision.
5. **Announcement**: An official announcement will be made to inform users of the de-listing, including the reasons and the effective date.
6. **Delisting Execution**: The asset will be removed from the platform on the specified date, and trading pairs involving the asset will be suspended.

## User Guidelines

- **Withdrawal Period**: Users will be provided with a withdrawal period to transfer their holdings of the de-listed asset to external wallets or other platforms.
- **Communication**: All updates and information regarding the de-listing will be communicated through official NYYU channels, including our website, social media, and email notifications.
